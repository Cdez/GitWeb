# OUTDATED
GitWeb is now implemented directly in to MrCrayfish's Device Mod and no longer requires this addon, thus this addon's development is over.

# GitWeb
An "Internet" Browser for MrCrayfish's Device Mod (1.12.2), that has community created websites

This is a textbased browser, that supports pages with Color & Styling codes based off the built in Minecraft colorcodes.

# Website Creation
https://github.com/MinecraftDoodler/GitWeb-Sites

# Accessing Sites
Within the Gitweb app you can access Gitweb sites with
'address.suffix' reffers to the filename within the root directory
of https://github.com/MinecraftDoodler/GitWeb-Sites, but you can also
access pastes from pastebin by entering 'pastebin:PASTEID' in the GitWeb
browser.
